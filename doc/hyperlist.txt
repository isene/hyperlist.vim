*hyperlist.txt*   The VIM plugin for HyperList (version 2.4.5, 2021-05-16)

HyperList is a way to describe anything - any state, item(s), pattern, action,
process, transition, program, instruction set etc. So, you can use it as an
outliner, a ToDo list handler, a process design tool, a data modeler, or any
other way you want to describe something.

This VIM plugin makes it easy to work with HyperLists. It has a vast range of
features - from (un)collapsing whole or parts of lists, autonumbering of items,
checkbox toggling, jumping to referenced items... to encryption, presentation 
modes, export to various formats, automatically transferring of items tagged
with future events to a Google calendar... and many more sexy features.

The VIM plugin version numbers correspond to the HyperList definition version
numbers with the VIM plugin adding another increment of versioning, e.g VIM
plugin version 2.4.5 would be compatible with HyperList definition version 2.4.

This documentation contains the full HyperList definition. For a more
comprehensive manual that also includes plenty of examples, read the official
definition document:

	http://isene.org/hyperlist/

Here you will also find HyperGraph - a Ruby script to graph both State
HyperLists (like mindmaps) and Transitions Hyperlists (like flowcharts).

HyperList was formerly known as WOIM. The ftdetect file contains the file
suffix ".woim" for backward compatability so that these file types are also
treated as HyperList files.

1 HyperList VIM Plugin                                      *HyperList-Plugin*

One of the most feature rich VIM plugins ever created.

This plugin does both highlighting and various automatic handling of
HyperLists, like collapsing lists or parts of lists in a sophisticated way. 
It includes encryption functionality.

The HyperList plugin for VIM consists of the main file put in the "syntax"
subdirectory.  It also includes a file in the "ftdetect" directory so that
files with a ".hl" extension is automatically detected and treated as a
HyperList file.

For a complete tutorial, go through the file HyperListTutorialAndTestSuite.hl
in the documentation folder (~/.vim/doc/HyperListTutorialAndTestSuite.hl).
This file also serves as a complete test suite for releases of this plugin.


WHEN WORKING WITH HYPERLISTS IN VIM:

Use tabs/shifts or * for indentations.

Use <SPACE> to toggle one fold. Use <c-SPACE> to toggle a fold recursively.
Use \0 to \9, \a, \b, \c, \d, \e, \f to show up to 15 levels expanded.

<leader># or <leader>an toggles autonumbering of new items (the previous
item must be numbered for the next item to be autonumbered). An item is
indented to the right with <c-t>, adding one level of numbering. An item
is indented to the left with <c-d>, removing one level of numbering and
increasing the number by one.

To number or renumber a set of items, select them visually (using V in VIM)
and press <leader>R. If the items are not previously numbered, they will now
be numbered from 1 and onward. Only items with the same indentation as the
first selected line will be numbered. If the first item is already numbered
(such as 1.2.6), the remaining items within the selection (with the same
indentation) will be numbered accordingly (such as 1.2.7, 1.2.8, etc.).

Use <leader>u to toggle underlining of States (prefixed with "S: " or "| "),
Transitions (prefixed with "T: " or "/ ") or underline nothing.

Use <leader>v to add a checkbox at start of item or to toggle a checkbox
Use <leader>V to add/toggle a checkbox with a date stamp for completion

Use "gr" (without the quotation marks, signifies "Goto Ref") or simply press
the "Enter" ("<CR>") key while the cursor is on a HyperList reference to jump
to that destination in a HyperList. Use "n" after a "gr" to verify that the
reference destination is unique. A reference can be to an Item in the list or 
to a file by the use of <file:/pathto/filename>, <file:~/filename> or 
<file:filename>. It can also be a relative reference like <-5> which would
mean "jump five lines up" or <+2> ("jump two lines down").

Use "gf" to open the file under the cursor. Graphic files are opened in
"feh", pdf files in "zathura" and MS/OOO docs in "LibreOffice". Other
filetypes are opened in VIM for editing. All this can be changed by
setting these global variables in your vimrc:
  let g:wordprocessingprogram = ""
  let g:spreadsheetprogram    = ""
  let g:presentationprogram   = ""
  let g:imageprogram          = ""
  let g:pdfprogram            = ""
  let g:browserprogram        = ""

Whenever you jump to a reference, the mark "'" is set at the point you jumped
from so that you may easily jump back by hitting "''" (single quoutes twice). 

Use <leader><SPACE> to go to the next open template element
(A template element is a HyperList item ending in an equal sign).

As a sort of "presentation mode", you can traverse a HyperList by using
g<DOWN> or g<UP> to view only the current line and its ancestors.
An alternative is <leader><DOWN> and <leader><UP> to open more levels down.

To highlight the current part of a HyperList (the current item and all its
children), press <leader>h. This will uncollapse the whole HyperList and dim
the whole HyperList except the current item and its children. To remove the
highlighting, simply press <leader>h again (the fold level is restored).

Use <leader>L to convert the entire document to LaTaX.

The LaTeX conversion includes color coding of the various elements similar to
the colors used for HyperList files within VIM.

Use <leader>H to convert the entire document to HTML.

The HTML conversion includes color coding of the various elements similar to
the colors used for HyperList files within VIM.

Use <leader>T to convert the entire document to a basic TPP presentation file.

Top level of the HyperList will become the presentation header. First indented
level will become headers on a new page. Other indented levels will be
preserved.  No HyperList coloring will be done. Bold, italics and underlined
parts of the HyperList will be preserved.

See https://github.com/cbbrowne/tpp for information on TPP (Text Presentation Program)

Use <leader>z to encrypt the current line (including all sublevels if folded).
Use <leader>Z to encrypt the current file (all lines).
Use <leader>x to decrypt the current line (mark all subsequent encrypted lines).
Use <leader>X to decrypt the current file (all lines).

If you enter the wrong password while trying to decrypt, you will end up with
garbage characters. To fix it, press "u" (undo) and try decrypting again with
the correct password.

If you want a HyperList to be automatically encrypted upon saving and decrypted
upon opening it, just prefix the filename with a dot (like ".password.hl"). It
then turns off viminfo and swapfiles to ensure security.

When using encryption in a HyperList or for the whole file, you will be asked
for a password - twice when saving the file and once when opening it. You must
have OpenSSL in your path to take advantage of these features.

When running gVIM under Windows, encryption will spawn a DOS window where you
enter the password for encryption/decryption. This window may be hidden under
other windows.

Syntax updated at start and every time you leave Insert mode, or you can press
"zx" to update the syntax. 

You may speed up larger HyperListS by setting the the global variable
"disable_collapse" - add the following to your .vimrc:

  let g:disable_collapse = 1

If you want to disable or override these keymaps with your own, simply add
to your .vimrc file:

  let g:HLDisableMapping = 1

To use HyperLists within other file types (other than ".hl"), you can use
"nested syntax" by adding the following to those syntax files (like the syntax
file for text files (".txt"):

  syn include @HL ~/.vim/syntax/hyperlist.vim
  syn region HLSnip matchgroup=Snip start="HLstart" end="HLend" contains=@HL
  hi link Snip SpecialComment

If you add those three lines in your .vim/syntax/txt.vim you will be able to
include HyperLists in files with a ".txt", and the following example would
become a HyperList with correct syntax highlighting and folding:

HLstart
This is a HyperList test list
	Here is a child to the above item
		Here is "grand child"
	Here we are one level back
		And here's another level down
		[5] Dance steps
		[3] Hurray
		Smile
HLend

The "HLstart" and "HLend" must be at the start of the line.

You can show/hide words or regex patterns by using these keys and commands:

	zs    Show all lines containing word under cursor
	zh    Hide all lines containing word under cursor
	z0    Go back to normal HyperList folding
	:SHOW word/pattern
			Show lines containing either word or pattern
	:HIDE word/pattern
			Hide lines containing either word or pattern
			Pattern can be any regular expression

This functionality is useful for easily showing e.g. a specific tag or hash. 
The functionality is taken from VIM script #1594 (thanks to Amit Sethi).

To sort a set of items at a specific indentation, visually select (V) the
items you want to sort (including all the children of those items) and press
<leader>s and the items in the range will be alphabetically sorted - but only
the items on the same level/indentation as the first item selected. The sorted
items will keep their children. This is useful if parts of a HyperList is 
numbered and you get the numbering out of sequence and wants to resort them.
One caveat, the last line in the selection cannot be the very last line in
the document (there must be an item or an empty line below it).

By doing :call CalendarAdd() all items containing a future date will be added
as reminders to your Google Calendar. If an item includes a time, the event is
added from that time with duration of 30 minutes.

This function requires gcalcli (https://github.com/insanum/gcalcli)

The function is mapped to <leader>G to add events to the default calendar. The
default calendar is defined as b:calendar at the start of the HyperList.vim
script. To add the events to another calendar, do :call CalendarAdd("yourcalendar")
The title of the calendar is the item in the HyperList without the date/time tag.
If there is no time tag for the item, an event is created at the start of the date.
If there is a time tag for the item, the event is created at that time with the
default duration (30 minutes). The description for the event is the item and all
its child items.

If you want to know the overall complexity of a HyperList, use <leader>C
The score shown is the total of Items and References in your HyperList.

GVIM users can enjoy a menu with most of the commands organized in submenus.

2 Background and definition                             *HyperList-Background*

Having worked extensively with flowcharts, relations diagrams, Warnier-Orr
diagrams and other ways of representing processes, states, instructions,
programs and data models, I knew there was something missing. It would have
been great to have a way of representing anything -- any state or action -- in
a way that would be more conducive to collaboration.

Most people know about flowcharts. But there are other ways of representing
data, states, actions or processes: UML, Sankey diagrams, Decision trees, Petri
Net, Organizational charts, Mind maps, Process Flow diagrams, Feynman diagrams,
Data Flow diagrams, Concept maps, OBASHI, Task lists (or Todo lists),
Warnier/Orr diagrams and various other diagrams. More than we can list here.
They have various uses, various strengths and shortcomings.

Most methodologies for representing states or flows were born out of specific
needs and were not meant to be used as generic methods for representing
literally anything as simple as possible. What if there were a way to represent
any state, set of things, actions, flows or transitions? What if the method
were simple? What if it were also Turing complete?

Enter HyperList -- a system for representing data. Any data. Static or dynamic.
It can be used to describe any state: a thing or set of things, an area, a
concept or collection of concepts, etc. It can also be used to describe any
action or plan, transformation or transition. In fact, it can describe anything
-- with one complete markup set. HyperList can be be used as an outliner on
steroids or a todo-list managing system with unlimited possibilities.

After searching for a complete markup methodology for both states or things and
actions or transitions, I came across the Warnier/Orr diagrams. They seemed to
be the best foundation for what I needed. The methodology was expanded to be
capable of describing anything as easily as possible; I removed the graphical
parts of Warnier/Orr and expanded the system substantially. It turned into WOIM
(Warnier/Orr/Isene/Möller) and later got the more descriptive name of
HyperList. Egil Möller (http://redhog.org/) helped in the early refinements.

Besides being the name of the system, "HyperList" is also used when referring
to a list or lists conforming to this system.

The strengths of HyperList are many:

 * can represent any state or action with any number of levels
 * Turing complete
 * text-based 
   (it is wiki-able -- i.e. it is easy to collaborate when creating HyperList)
 * not graphical 
   (although it can easily be made graphical for ease of consumption or eye candy)
 * an easy syntax, humanly very readable
 * very compact
 * can represent negatives ("NOT:" = "don't do the following actions")
 * can represent any number of choices in a decision (hard to do in a flowchart)
 * easy to do loop counts
 * easy to show attributes such as time or timing, location, person responsible, etc.
 * potentially easy to map to other representation methods (graphical or otherwise)

In its simplest form, a HyperList is just a list of Items -- like your regular
shopping list -- but it can be so much more if you need it to be. A couple of
examples will give you the basic idea.

An example of describing a state:

	Car (example obviously not complete)
		Exterior
			Paint
			Chrome decor
			Windows
				Rubber linings
			[4] Wheels
		Interior
			Seats
				[2] Front
				[3] Back
		Mechanics
			Motor
				[6] Cylinders
				[24] Valves
			Brakes

A transition example (task list):

	Walk the dog
		Check the weather
			[?rain] AND/OR:
				Get rain coat
				Get umbrella
			Dress for the temperature
		Get chain
		Call the dog
		OR:
			Go through the woods
			Walk the usual track
		AND: (concurrency)
			Ensure the dog has done its "tasks"
			Ensure the dog is exercised
			  [5+] throw the favorite stick
		Walk home

And this can all be done in collaboration on a wiki. States are described,
processes are mapped, plans and todo lists are forged. It's rather easy, and
HyperList can accommodate any level of complexity.

3 HyperLists                                                      *HyperLists*

A HyperList consists of one or more HyperList Items.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4 HyperList Item                                              *HyperList-Item*

A HyperList Item is a line in a HyperList. It can have "children". Children are
HyperList Items indented to the right below the Item.

A HyperList Item consists of an optional "Starter", an optional "Type",
"Content" and a "Separator" in that sequence. All the various parts of a
HyperList Item are described below and in the sequence they appear in an Item,
as outlined here:

	4.1 Starter   
	4.2 Type
	4.3 Content
		4.3.1 Element 
			4.3.1.1 Operator
			4.3.1.2 Qualifier
			4.3.1.3 Property
			4.3.1.4 Description 
		4.3.2 Additive
			4.3.2.1 Reference
			4.3.2.2 Tag 
			4.3.2.3 Comment  
			4.3.2.4 Quote
			4.3.2.5 Change Markup
	4.4 Separator

Look familiar? Yes, it is part of the table of contents at the beginning of
this documentation -- even that is a valid HyperList. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 Starter                                                *HyperList-Starter*

A HyperList Item may begin with a "Starter". A "Starter" can be either an
"Identifier" or a "Multi-line Indicator".

An Identifier is a unique indicator that can be used in referring to that Item.
A numbering scheme such as X.Y.Z can be used, e.g. the first Item in a
HyperList would be 1. The second Item would be 2, etc. A child to the second
Item would be 2.1 and the second child of 2 would be identified as 2.2, whereas
the child of 2.2 would be 2.2.1.

A shorter form consisting of mixing numbers and letters can also be used, such
as 1A1A for the first fourth-level Item. The next fourth-level Item would be
1A1B. When using this scheme, there is no need for any periods. The Identifier
"21T2AD" would be equivalent to "21.20.2.30", saving 4 characters.

An Item that spans more than one line must have a Starter. It does not have to
be an Identifier. You may use a "Multi-line Indicator" instead; just prefix the
Item with a plus sign ("+"), to show that it spans more than one line.    The
second line of an Item will be indented to the same level/indent as the first
with an added space in front.    If you use a Starter on one Item, then all the
Items in that same group of Items on the same level/indent must also have a
Starter.

In the example below, the first child begins with an Identifier and the second
a Multi-line Indicator. A Multi-line Indicator can also be used for single-line
Items when other Items on the same level span more than one line and thus
require a Multi-line Indicator.

	Multi-line Indicator = "+"
		1. Following lines are of the same indent with a "space" before
		 the text
		+ If one Item on a certain level/indent is multi-line, all Items
		 on the same level/indent must start with a plus sign ("+") or <Identifier> 

The angle brackets near the end will be discussed later in this article.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2 Type                                                      *HyperList-Type*

If it is not obvious or for clarity or strictness, prefix an Item with "S:" if
the Item is a static or a state Item (i.e. something which does not denote
action). Use "T:" for a transition Item (an Item indicating action).
Alternately, you may use "|" instead of "S:", and "/" instead of "T:". The Type
indicator comes after the optional Starter.

Children of a certain Type (either state or transition) inherit their parent's
Type unless otherwise specified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3 Content                                                *HyperList-Content*

A HyperList Item must have some sort of Content. The Content can be an
"Element" and/or an "Additive".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3.1 Elements                                            *HyperList-Elements*

An Element is either an "Operator", a "Qualifier", a "Property" or a
"Description". Let's treat each of these concepts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3.1.1 Operator                                          *HyperList-Operator*

An Operator is anything that operates on an Item or a set of Items. It can be
any of the usual logical operators. It can also be other Operators, such as
"EXAMPLE: ", "EXAMPLES: ", "CHOOSE: ", "ONE OF THESE: ", "IMPLIES: ",
"CONTINUOUS: ", etc. The Operator "CONTINUOUS: " makes an Item or set of Items
run continuously. An Operator is written in capital letters and ends in a colon
and a space.

The Operator "ENCRYPTION: " indicates that the sub-Item(s) are to be encrypted
or that the following block is encrypted. The encrypted block can be properly
indented in the HyperList, or if indentation is part of the encrypted block, it
will be left justified. This is the only Item that is allowed to break the
indentation rules. 

If you need to include one or more lines inside a HyperList that include
HyperList expressions you don't want to be interpreted as HyperList
expressions, then use a "literal block". This is equivalent to "pre-formatted"
text in HTML and some word processors. To include such a block of lines, simply
mark the start and end of the literal block with a single backslash ("\") on a
line. Example:

   \
   This is a block of literal text...
   Where nothing counts as HyperList markup
   Thus - neither this: [?] nor THIS: <Test> - are seen as markup
   ...until we end this block with...
   \

Literal blocks are useful when you want to include, for instance, a block of
programming code in the middle of a HyperList.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3.1.2 Qualifier                                        *HyperList-Qualifier*

A Qualifier does as its name suggests; it qualifies an Item. A Qualifier limits
the use of an Item. It tells you how many times, at what times and/or under
what conditions an Item is to be executed, exists or is valid. When an Item is
to be included only if several conditions are met, you put all the conditions
into square brackets and separate them by commas. If an Item is to be executed
first for one condition, then for another and then for a third, etc, you
separate them by periods. The usage is best described by a few examples:

* Do Item if "the mail has arrived" = "[The mail has arrived]"
* Do Item 3 times = "[3]"
* Do Item 1 or more times = "[1+]"
* Do Item 2 to 4 times = "[2..4]" (the user may choose 2, 3 or 4 times)
* Do Item 2 times while "foo=true" = "[2, foo=true]"
* Do Item from 3 to 5 times while "bar=false" = "[3..5, bar=false]"
* Do Item less than 4 times only while "zoo=0" = "[<4, zoo=0]"
* Do Item 1 or more times while "Bob is polite" = "[1+, Bob is polite]"
* Do Item a minimum 2 and a maximum 7 of times while it rains and temperature
  is less than 5 degrees Celsius = "[2..7, Raining, Temperature <5°C]"
* Do Item in the context of "apples", then "oranges", then "grapes" =
	"[Apples. Oranges. Grapes]". With this you can reuse a procedure in many
	contexts.

You can add a question mark before the qualifier statement to make it clearer
that it is an ``if'' statement. These are equivalent:

   [? Raining] Bring unbrella
	 
   [Raining] Bring unbrella

To indicate that an Item is optional, use "[?]". Example:

   Receive calls at reception
      Pick up the phone and greet the caller
      [Caller does not ask for any specific person]
         Ask who the caller wants to speak to
      [?] Ask the reason for wanting to talk to that person
      [Person available] Transfer call; END
      [Person not available] Ask if you can leave a message
         Take the message
         Send the message to the person

The special word "END" and the semicolon in the above example will be explained
later, under "Reference" and "Separator", respectively.

Use a "timestamp" to indicate that an Item is to be done at a certain time, in
a certain time span, before or after a certain time, etc.

A timestamp has the format "YYYY-MM-DD hhmmss", conforming to the standard
ISO-8601. The time/date format can be shortened to the appropriate time
granularity, such as "YYYY-MM-DD hhmm", "YYYY-MM-DD hh" or "YYYY". One can add
a timestamp Qualifier such as "[Time = 2012-12-24 17]" or simply "[2012-12-24 17]".

Timestamps that represent an amount of time may be relative, such as:

* Length of time to wait before doing the Item = "[+YYYY-MM-DD]"
* Less than a certain length of time after previous Item = "[<+YYYY-MM-DD]"
* More than a certain length of time after previous Item = "[>+YYYY-MM-DD]"
* Length of time to wait  before doing next Item = "[-YYYY-MM-DD]"
* Less than a certain length of time before next Item = "[<-YYYY-MM-DD]"
* More than a certain length of time before next Item = "[>-YYYY-MM-DD]"
* Length of time to wait after doing referenced Item = "[+YYYY-MM-DD<OtherItem>]"

The last example introduces a new concept, the "Reference". References will be
discussed below.

Other obvious timestamps may be used, such as:

* "[+1 week]"
* "[-2 Martian years]"

Some practical examples:

* Wait one month before doing the Item = "[+YYYY-01-DD]"
* Do Item less than 4 days before next Item = "[<-YYYY-MM-04]"
* Wait one year and two days after Item X = "[+0001-00-02<X>]"

It is also possible to have recurring Items in \hyperlist. The strict format is
"YYYY-MM-DD+X DAY hh.mm+Y - YYYY-MM-DD hh.mm". The first date marks the
starting date and the last date marks the end of the repetition interval. The
"+X" is the repetition (i.e. the number of days between each repetition) in
relation to the date, while the "+Y" is the repetition of the time (the amount
of time between each repetition). "DAY" represents the name of the day(s) in
the week where recurring Item occurs. You use what you need, i.e. if there is
no repetition within a day, obviously the "+Y" would be skipped.  
Some examples:

* "[2012-05-01+7 13.00]" = 2011-05-01 1pm, repeated every 7 days
* "[2012-05-01+2,3,2]" = Every 2, then 3, then 2 days, in repetition
* "[2012-05-01+2 - 2012-05-01]" = Every second day for one year
* "[2012-05-01 13.00+1]" = 2011-05-01 1pm, repeated every hour
* "[2012-05-01 Fri,Sat - 2011-10-01]" = Every Fri & Sat in the repetition interval

You can also use all possible intuitive variations by leaving certain parts of
the timestamp unspecified.

* "[YYYY-MM-03]" = Every third of every month
* "[YYYY-12-DD]" = Every day in every December
* "[2011-MM-05]" = The fifth of every month of 2011
* "[Tue,Fri 12.00]" = Noon every Tuesday and Friday

Here is a complex Qualifier example:

   [+YYYY-MM-DD 02.30, Button color = Red, 4, ?] Push button

The above statement reads "2 hours and 30 minutes after previous Item, if the
color of the button is red, then push the button 4 times, if you want to".

If you use HyperList as a todo-list manager or project management tool, there
is a nifty way of showing Items to be done and Items done; simply add "[_]" at
the beginning of the line for an "unchecked" Item and "[x]" for a "checked"
Item. An unchecked Item is to be done and is indicated by this "placeholder"
Qualifier, while a checked item indicates the Item is not to be done anymore.

You may add a timestamp for the completion after a checked Item ("[x]
YYYY-MM-DD hh.mm:"). In this way, you combine the Qualifier with a timestamp
Tag. The timestamp as a Tag does not limit when the Item is to be done. It
supplies information about when it was done.

4.3.1.2 Property                                          *HyperList-Property*

A Property is any attribute describing the Content. It ends in a colon and a
space.

Examples of Properties could be: "Location = Someplace:", "Color = Green:",
"Strength = Medium:" and "In Norway:". Anything that gives additional
information or description to the Content.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3.1.3 Description                                    *HyperList-Description*

The Description is the main body, the "meat" of the Item. Although an Item may
not have a Description, such as a line containing only the Operator "OR:", most
Items do have a Description. Many Items have only a Description, such as those
in a simple todo list.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3.2 Additive                                            *HyperList-Additive*

Additives can be used alone or in combination with Elements. An Additive can
either be a "Reference", a "Comment", a "Quote" or a "Change Markup".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3.2.1 Reference                                        *HyperList-Reference*

A reference is enclosed in angle brackets ("<>"). A reference can be the name
of an Item, another HyperList or anything else. An example would be a Reference
to a website, such as <http://www.isene.org/>, a file,
<file:/path/to/filename>, or another item <The referenced item's Description>.

There are two types of References:

 * A redirection or hard Reference
 * A soft Reference

An Item consisting only of a Reference is a redirection. For a transition Item
this means one would jump to the referenced Item and continue execution from
there. If the redirect is to jump back after executing the referenced Item (and
its children), then add another hash at the beginning, such as <<Reference>>.
This makes it easy to create more compact HyperList by adding a set of
frequently used subroutines at the end of the list. For a state Item, a
Reference means one would include the referenced Item (and its children) at the
Reference point.

There are two special redirections for transition Items:

 * An Item consisting only of the key word "SKIP" ends the current HyperList level
 * An Item consisting only of the key word "END" ends the whole HyperList

If the Reference is only part of an Item, it is a "soft Reference". It
indicates that one would look for more information at the referenced Item. An
even softer Reference would be to put the Reference in parentheses, such as
(<Reference>), indicating that the referenced Item is only something apropos.
Parentheses are used for Comments and will be discussed later.

A Reference can be to any place in the list, up or down, or to another list or
to a file, a web address or any other place that can be referred to with a
unique name used as the Reference. Although the Reference is valid as long as
it is unique and therefore unambiguous, you should note the following best
practice for a Reference: 

If you reference an Item higher up in the HyperList, a simple reference to the
Item is all that is needed. One would refer to the Identifier or to the
appropriate Content, usually the Description. Examples:

	The first Item
		A child Item
			A grandchild
				<A child Item>

It would make sense to use an Identifier for an Item if the Description is long
and you want to refer to that Item: 

	The first Item
		1 A child Item
			A grandchild
				<1>

If you refer to an Item further down the hierarchy, you would use a forward
slash ("/") to separate each level (like the "path" used in a URL):

	The first Item
		A child Item (<A grandchild/A baby>)
			A grandchild
				A baby

If you want to refer to an Item where you first need to "climb the tree" and
then go down another "branch", you start the path with the highest common level
and reference the path from there:

	The first Item
		A child Item
			A grandchild
	Another branch
		A leaf
			<The first Item/A child Item/A grandchild>

Or, if the referenced Item has a unique identifier, simply use that:

	The first Item
		A child Item
			1 A grandchild
	Another branch
		A leaf
			<1>

You may use a unique concatenation of a path to shorten it, such as 
<Somewhere higher up/One lev.../Ref...>. The three periods indicate
concatenation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3.2.2 Tag                                                    *HyperList-Tag*

A Tag is a "marker" for an item. It tags an item and is used just like hashtags
in Twitter. Examples: #TODO #RememberThis #First #SandraLyng. No spaces are
allowed in a tag.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3.2.2 Comment                                            *HyperList-Comment*

Anything within parentheses is a Comment. Comments are are not executed as
HyperList commands -- i.e. in a list of transition Items, they are not actions
to be executed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3.2.3 Quote                                                *HyperList-Quote*

Anything in quotation marks is a Quote. Like a Comment, a Quote is not executed
as a HyperList command.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3.2.4 Change Markup                                 *HyperList-ChangeMarkup*

When working with HyperList, especially on paper, there may come a need to mark
deletion of Items or to show where an Item should be moved to. To accommodate
this need, Change Markup is introduced. Change markup is a special type of Tag.

If "##<" is added at the end of an Item, it is slated for deletion. To show
that an Item should be moved, add "##>" at the end followed by a Reference
showing to which Item it should be moved below.

To indent an Item to the left, add "##<-". Indenting an Item to the right is
marked by "##->". It is possible to combine moving and indenting an Item, i.e.
moving an Item and making it a child of another: "##>><Ref>##->".

To signify that an Item has been changed from a previous version of a
HyperList, prefix the Item with "##text##". Inside the hash signs you may
include information about the change done, e.g. "##John 2012-03-21##" to show
that the Item was changed by a certain person at a given time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.4 Separator                                            *HyperList-Separator*

A Separator separates one Item from another. A line in a HyperList is usually
one Item, and Items are then usually separated by a "newline" (hitting the
"Enter" on the keyboard). But it is possible to string several Items together
on one line by separating them with semicolons.

By separating an Item by a newline and then indenting it to the right, you
create a child Item. A child adds information to its parent.

A Separator between two Items with the same or less indent is normally read as
"then". If a parent Item contains a description, the newline Separator and
indent to the right (a child) reads "with" or "consists of". If a parent Item
does not contain a Description, the Separator and indent to the right (a child)
is read as "applies to", and a Separator between the children is read as "and".
A few examples should suffice:

	A kitchen
		Stove
		Table
			Plates
			Knives
			Forks

This would read: "A kitchen with stove and table with plates, knives and
forks".

	Time = 2010:
		Olympic Games
		Soccer world championship

This would read: "Time = 2010: applies to: Olympic Games and Soccer world
championship".

	Walk the dog
		Check the weather
			[?rain] AND/OR:
				Get rain coat
				Get umbrella
			Dress for the temperature
		Get chain

And this would read: "Walk the dog consists of Check the weather consists of:
If rain, AND/OR: applies to children: Get rain coat, Get umbrella; then Dress
for the temperature, then Get chain". Or more humanly: "Walk the dog consists
of check the weather, which consists of either/or get the rain coat and get
umbrella. Then dress for the temperature and then get the chain."

Now consider these four examples:

   Production
      Station 1
         Assemble parts A-G
      Station 2
         Assemble parts H-R
      Station 3
         Assemble parts S-Z

   Production
      Station 1; Assemble parts A-G
      Station 2; Assemble parts H-R
      Station 3; Assemble parts S-Z

   Production
      [Station 1]
         Assemble parts A-G
      [Station 2]
         Assemble parts H-R
      [Station 3]
         Assemble parts S-Z

   Production
      [Station 1] Assemble parts A-G
      [Station 2] Assemble parts H-R
      [Station 3] Assemble parts S-Z

The first and second examples say exactly the same thing, but the second
example is more efficient as it uses the semicolon as a Separator instead of
using a line break and indent. The same goes for the third and the fourth
examples -- they are equivalent. But how about the difference between the first
two examples and the last two?

When you use a Qualifier as in examples three and four, you accommodate for the
tasks getting done in any chosen sequence. In those two examples, the
production could go, for example, "Station 1", then "Station 3", then "Station 2".

The first and second examples read: "The production consists of: Station 1
assembles parts A-G, then Station 2 assembles parts H-R and finally Station 3
assembles parts S-Z".

The third and fourth examples read: "The production consists of: if or when at
Station 1, assemble parts A-G, if or when at Station 2, assemble parts H-R, and
if or when at Station 3, assemble parts S-Z".

As you can see, there is a subtle but distinct difference.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5 A self-defining system                           *HyperList-Self-definition*

Now that we have covered all the possibilities in a HyperList, it should be
obvious that HyperList could extend into a vast array of descriptions. It is
even possible to write a parser or compiler for HyperList and use it as a
programming language.

Is it possible to compact the descriptions above into a HyperList? Yes, indeed.
The HyperList system is self-describing.

HyperList can be done in many different ways -- from informal to strict and
from high-level to very detailed. The power of the tool resides with the user.

To illustrate the flexibility of HyperList, we will show the definition of this
methodology in three steps -- from a very informal and high-level description,
to a more strict but still high-level -- to the fully-detailed definition of
HyperList.

First, here is a simple list showing what HyperList is all about:

	HyperList Item parts (in sequence): 
		Starter (optional)
			Identifier or Multi-line Indicator
		Type (optional)
			State or transition
		Content (can be an Element and/or an Additive)
			Element
				Either an Operator, Qualifier, Property, or Description
			Additive    
				Either a Reference, Tag, Comment, Quote, or Change Markup
		Separator
			Newline or semicolon

Now, that's a very simple HyperList. Let's make the same simple list more
strict by using the system concisely:

	HyperList Item parts
		[?] Starter; OR:
			Identifier
			Multi-line Indicator
		[?] Type; OR:
			State
			Transition
		Content; AND/OR:
			Element; AND/OR:
				Operator
				Qualifier
				Property
				Description
			Additive; AND/OR:
				Reference
				Tag
				Comment
				Quote
				Change Markup
		Separator; OR:
			Newline
			Semicolon

That wasn't so intricate either, and that list is more easily parsable by a
computer program if one wanted to automatically create graphical
representation.

How about the full and complete definition, including all imaginable details of
how any HyperList could conceivably be structured. Fasten your seat belt.

The following list shows the legal structure and syntax of a HyperList. It
covers all you have read above. 

HLstart
HyperList
	[1+] HyperList Item
		[?] Starter; OR: 
			Identifier (Numbers: Format = "1.1.1.1", Mixed: Format = "1A1A")
				[? Multi-line Item] The Identifier acts like the plus sign ("+")
			Multi-line Indicator = "+"
				+ If one Item on a certain indent is multi-line, all Items on the same indent
				 (including single-line Items) must start with a plus sign ("+")} or <Identifier>
				 and all lines on the same indent after the first line must start with a space
		[?] Type
			OR: 
				State = "S:" or "|"
				Transition = "T:" or "/"
			Children inherit Type from parent unless marked with different Type
			Can be skipped when the Item is obviously a state or transition
		Content; AND/OR: 
			Element; AND/OR:	
				Operator
					Anything operating on an Item or a set of Items
						[? Set of Items] Items are indented below the Operator
					Can be any of the usual logical operators
					Is written in capitals ending in a colon and a space
						EXAMPLES: "AND: ", "OR: ", "AND/OR: ", "NOT: ", "IMPLIES: "
					Can contain a Comment to specify the Operator
						EXAMPLE: "OR(PRIORITY): "
							Sub-Items are to be chosen in the order of priority as listed
					To make the Item run continuously, use "CONTINUOUS: " 
						Item is done concurrent with remaining Items
						The Operator can be combined with a timestamp Tag
							EXAMPLE: "CONTINUOUS: YYYY-MM-07:" = Do the Item weekly
					To show that an Item is encrypted or is to be encrypted, use "ENCRYPTION: "
						OR: 
							 The encrypted block can be correctly indented
							 The encrypted block contains indentation and is left justified
									This would seem to break the list, but is allowed
					A block can be included of "literal text" negating any HyperList markup
						Use a HyperList Item containing only the Operator "\"} to mark start/end
							EXAMPLE: 
								\
								This is a block of literal text...
								Where nothing counts as HyperList markup
								Thus - neither this: [?] nor THIS: <Test> - are seen as markup
								...until we end this block with...
								\
				Qualifier
					Any statement in square brackets that qualifies an Item
					Specifies under what conditions an Item is to be executed, exists or is valid
					Several Qualifiers can be strung together, separated by commas
						All Qualifiers need to be fulfilled for the Item to be valid
						EXAMPLE: "[+YYYY-MM-DD 02.30, Button color = Red, 4, ?] Push button"
					Successive Qualifiers can be strung together, separated by periods; EXAMPLE: 
						"[Apples. Oranges. Grapes]"
							Do Item in the context of "apples", then "oranges", then "grapes"
					EXAMPLES: 
						Do Item 3 times = "[3]"
						Do Item if "the mail has arrived" = "[The mail has arrived]"
						Do Item 2 times while "foo=true" = "[2, foo=true]"
						Do Item from 3 to 5 times while "bar=false" = "[3..5, bar=false]"
						Do Item 1 or more times = "[1+]"
						Do Item 1 or more times while "Bob is polite" = "[1+, Bob is polite]"
						Do Item up to 4 times only while "zoo=0" = "[<4, zoo=0]"
					Optional Item = "[?]"
					Timestamp Qualifier = "[YYYY-MM-DD hh.mm.ss]"
						Shorten the format to the appropriate granularity
					Time relations
						Length of time to wait before doing the Item = "[+YYYY-MM-DD]"
						Less than a certain length of time after previous Item = "[<+YYYY-MM-DD]"
						More than a certain length of time after previous Item = "[>+YYYY-MM-DD]"
						Length of time to wait  before doing next Item = "[-YYYY-MM-DD]"
						Less than a certain length of time before next Item = "[<-YYYY-MM-DD]"
						More than a certain length of time before next Item = "[>-YYYY-MM-DD]"
						Length of time to wait after doing referenced Item = "[+YYYY-MM-DD<Item]>"
						Other obvious time indicators may be used; EXAMPLES: 
							"[+1 week]"
							"[-2 Martian years]"
						EXAMPLES: 
							Wait one month before doing the Item = "[+YYYY-01-DD]"
							Do Item less than 4 days before next Item = "[<-YYYY-MM-04]"
							Wait one year and two days after Item X = "[+0001-00-02<X>]"
						Time repetition
							Obvious/intuitive repetition
								EXAMPLES: 
									"[YYYY-MM-03]" = The third of every month
									"[YYYY-12-DD]" = Every day in every December
									"[2011-MM-05]" = The fifth of every month of 2011
									"[Tue,Fri 12.00]" = Noon every Tuesday and Friday
							Strict convention
								Format = YYYY-MM-DD+X Day hh.mm+Y - YYYY-MM-DD hh.mm; EXAMPLES: 
									"[2011-05-01+7 13.00]" = 2011-05-01 1pm, repeated every 7 days
									"[2011-05-01+2,3,2]" = Every 2, then 3, then 2 days, in repetition
									"[2011-05-01+2 - 2012-05-01]" = Every second day for one year
									"[2011-05-01 13.00+1]" = 2011-05-01 1pm, repeated every hour
									"[2011-05-01 Fri,Sat - 2011-10-01]" = Every Fri & Sat in time interval
						Checking off Items
							Unchecked Item = "[_]"
							Checked Item = "[x]" 
								[?] Timestamp Tag after ("[x] YYYY-MM-DD hh.mm:ss:")
				Property
					Any attribute to the <Content>, ending in a colon and a space
						Gives additional information or description to the Item
					EXAMPLES: 
						"Location = Someplace:", "Color = Green:", "Strength = Medium:" and "In Norway:"
				Description
					The main body of the HyperList Item, the "meat" of the line
			Additive; AND/OR: 
				Reference
					+ An Item name or Identifier, list name or anything else
					 enclosed in angle brackets ("<>"); EXAMPLES: 
						Reference to a website = "<http://www.isene.org/>"
						Reference to a file = "<file:/path/to/filename>"
					+ There are two types of References; OR: 
						Redirection (hard Reference)
							An Item consisting only of a Reference is a redirection
								For a transition Item = Jump to referenced Item and execute
									+ If the redirect is to jump back after executing 
									 the referenced Item (and its children), then add another 
									 set of angle brackets (<<Referenced Item>>)
										+ EXAMPLE: Use this when creating subroutines at 
										 the end of the list
								For a state Item = Include the referenced Item
							An Item consisting only of the key word "SKIP"
								Ends the current HyperList level
							An Item consisting only of the key word "END" 
								Ends the whole HyperList
						Soft Reference
							Reference is part of an Item
								Look at referenced Item for info only
							Even softer Reference = have the Reference in parentheses
								An Item that is only something apropos
					+ A Reference to any Item upward in the HyperList is simply a
					 Reference to the Item's <Content>
					+ A Reference containing several levels down a HyperList needs a "/" 
					 to separate each level, like a "path" (as with a URL) to the Item
					+ To make a Reference to a different branch in a HyperList, 
					 start the Reference from the highest common level on the list
					 and include all Items down to the referenced Item
						EXAMPLE: Reference from here to <Hyperlist Item/Starter/Identifier>
					+ For long Items in a Reference, concatenation can be used
						The concatenation must be unique
							EXAMPLE: Reference from here to <Additive/Comment/Anything...>
				Tag
					A hash sign followed by any letters or numbers, used as a marker (#Tagged)
					Is not executed as a HyperList command
				Comment
					Anything within parentheses is a Comment
					Is not executed as a HyperList command
				Quote
					Anything in quotation marks is a Quote
					Is not executed as a HyperList command
				Change Markup; OR: 
					Deletion
						Remove the Item by adding "##<" at the end of the Item
					Motion; OPTIONS: 
						Move the Item by adding "##><Reference>"
							This moves the Item just below the referenced Item
						Move the Item one level in by adding "##<-" at the end of the Item
						Move the Item one level out by adding "##->" at the end of the Item
							EXAMPLE: Move an Item as a child to referenced Item = "##><Reference>##->"
					Changed Item
						Prefix an Item with "##Text##" to signify that a change has been made
							Add information inside the angle brackets as appropriate
								EXAMPLE: To show who changed it and when = "##John 2012-03-21##"
		Separator 
			OR: 
				Semicolon
					A semicolon is used to separate two HyperList Items on the same line
				Newline
					Used to add another Item on the same level
					Indent
						A Tab or an asterisk ("*")}
							Used to add a child
								A child adds information to its parent
								A child is another regular <HyperList Item>
			Definition
				A Separator and the same or less indent normally reads "then:"
				[? Parent contains <Description>]} 
					The Separator and right indent reads "with:" or "consists of:"
				[? NOT: parent contains <Description>]} 
					The Separator and right indent reads "applies to:"
					A Separator between the children reads "and:"
HLend

Read and re-read the HyperList above and you will be a HyperList master after a
while. It's all there. The whole markup.

	items in the range will be alphabetically sorted - but only the items on the
	same level/indentation as the first item selected. The sorted items will
	keep their children. This is useful if parts of a HyperList is numbered and
	you get the numbering out of sequence and wants to resort them.  One caveat,
	the last line in the selection cannot be the very last line in the document
	(pthere must be an item or an empty line below it).

VERSION 1.4	    2011-05-23
	This could have been the long awaited version 1.0 - but instead I decided to
	synchronize the version numbering of this VIM plugin and the WOIM description
	itself. From now on the releases will be synchronized, with minor fixes in
	the VIM plugin released as minor releases (i.e. a fix to 1.4 would be 1.4.1
	and would still be on par with the WOIM definition version 1.4). The version
	1.4 of the WOIM definition adds time repetition as well as "checking" of
	todo-list items.

	This release:
	New feature: Added the option of checkboxes for items (Thanks to Christopher
	Truett (VIM script #3584). You can now easily add a checkbox in front of any
	item by <leader>v and subsequently toggle that checkbox via the same
	(<leader>v) or <leader>V if you want to add a time stamp to a box that you
	"check" (this also toggles the timestamp if you "uncheck" the item).
	Fixes: Some minor cleanup.

VERSION 0.9.9   2011-04-17
	Fix: Fixed interference between Operators and Tags

VERSION 0.9.8   2010-12-14
	Feature: States (S:) is underlined by default.  <leader>s removes the
	underlining, while <leader>S turns on underlining of States.  Transitions are
	not underlined by default.  <leader>T turns on underlining, while <leader>t
	removes the underlining of Transitions.
	Fix: Removed unnecessary "contained" to make lists syntax marked even within stub lists.
	Fix: Small fixes in grouping and containing of elements.

VERSION 0.9.6   2010-12-03
	Feature: Added "*" as possible indentation
	Fix:     Changed Multiline indicator from "*" to "+"
	Now compatible with WOIM v. 1.2

VERSION 0.9.3   2009-12-11
	Christian Bryn caught an important bug/lacking setting. The syntax file
	now sets noexpandtab.

	A few needed minor fixes.

VERSION 0.9.1   2009-08-21

	<<       means "delete this item" (put at the end of a line)
	>>#1.1.  means "move this item to after item 1.1."

	<-<-     means "indent item two left"
	>>#1.->  means "move item to after item 1. and indent right"

			 Deadline =
