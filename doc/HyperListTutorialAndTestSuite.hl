HyperList Test Suite (V1.0); Press '\f' to uncollapse this whole HyperList
	This HyperList serves two purposes
		A tutorial for all hyperlist.vim features 
			Do each item and you will learn all the features of this VIM plugin
		A fully fledged test suite
			Doing each item will confirm the plugin version is working correctly
	Requires the files HyperListTestSuite.hl and hyperlist.vim
		Set the cursor on a file link and press 'gf' to open the file; OR: 
			vim: <~/.vim/doc/HyperList.hl>
			nvim: <~/.local/share/nvim/site/doc/HyperList.hl>
	Tests are broken into 3 major categories, "SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING", "FUNCTIONALITY TEST" And "MENU TEST"
	SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING
		Ensure that all HyperList elements are correctly highlighted in the HyperList definition file; OR: 
			vim: <~/.vim/doc/HyperList.hl>
			nvim: <~/.local/share/nvim/site/doc/HyperList.hl>
		Check: The Property should be in red
		CHECK: The Operator should be in blue
		[? OK] Qualifier in green
		A #hashtag should be in yellow; And the preceding semicolon in green
		1. The numbering is an identifier and should appear in magenta
		+ The multi-line indicator should appear in red
		 and indicates the item runs across more than one line
		This link should be in magenta <link to nowhere>
		This comment should be in teal with the link inside in magenta (the <link to nowhere>)
		Quotes are also in "teal" and with "links inside in magenta, <link to nowhere>"
		Check (comment): Comment within a Property should be in teal
		Keywords END and SKIP should be in magenta
		Keywords FIXME and TODO should be in black on yellow
		Markup like *bold* /italics/ and _underline_ should appear correctly
		Fold this item and child by pressing 'SPACE' and see that it appears in bold
			This is a child item
		Press '\h' and move the cursor one line down
			This line should appear as normal while all other lines are dimmed
			Press '\h' again to remove the highlighting
		Collapse and uncollapse the next line to hide/show the literal block of lines
		\
			Check: This "literal" block should not contain any colors
			[? OK] *bold* /italics/ _underline_ FIXME TODO #hashtag
		\
		Check that State items and Transition items are underlined correctly
			By pressing '\u' State items should be underlined
			Pressing it again, Transition items should be underlined
			Pressing it a third time should toggle off underling of such items
			Now press '\u' three times
				S: This is a state item (indicates an item that is describing something)
				| This is a state item (indicates an item that is describing something)
				T: This is a transition item (indicates an item to be done/processed)
				/ This is a transition item (indicates an item to be done/processed)
	FUNCTIONALITY TEST
		Toggle folds; Press 'SPACE' twice to see the child of this line collapse and uncollapse
			This is a child item
		On the next item, press 'CONTROL+SPACE' twice to see that the fold toggles recursively
		Do all these: '\3' '\4' '\5' '\6' '\7' '\8' '\9' '\a' '\b' '\c' '\d' '\e' '\f'
			Observe that the children appear at the correct fold level
			'\3'
				'\4'
					'\5' 
						'\6' 
							'\7'
								'\8'
									'\9'
										'\a'
											'\b'
												'\c'
													'\d'
														'\e'
															'\f'
		By placing the cursor in the reference and press 'gr' you jump to the next item (<42>)
		42. This is an item that you will jump to
		By placing the cursor in the file reference and press 'gf' you open the HyperList definition file; OR: 
			vim: <~/.vim/doc/HyperList.hl>
			nvim: <~/.local/share/nvim/site/doc/HyperList.hl>
		Close that file to come back to this file
		Toggle autonumbering of items
			Press '\an' or '\#' to toggle autonumbering on/off; Press '\an' now and go to next line
				You should see the message "Autonumber ON"
			1.1. Go to the end of this line and enter insert mode and press enter
			1.3. You should now have a line "1.2." above this line
				Place the cursor on that "1.2." line in normal mode and press 'CTRL-T'
					Observe that it numbers the line as a child of "1.1." (1.1.1.)
				On that line, press 'CTRL-D' to observe it goes back to "1.2."
			Press '\#' to toggle off autonumbering; You should see the message "Autonumber OFF"
		Sort lines correctly
			The following lines are incorrectly sorted
				2 Item2
				3 Item3
					3.1 Child of Item3
				1 Item1
					1.1 Child of Item1
			Mark the numbered lines visually ('V') and press '\s'
				Observe that the lines are now sorted correctly with their children in the right places
		Create and use checkboxes for items
			With the cursor on this line, press '\v' to see a checkbox appear
				With the cursor on the above line, press '\v' again to see an "x" appear in the checkbox
			[_] With the cursor on this line, press '\V' to mark the checkbox with a time stamp
		Show/hide items with specific words
			This is an item with the word "simple"
			This is an item with the word "amazing"
			This is an item with the word "simple"
			Now go to the word "simple" and press 'zs'
			Observe that all items that does not contain "simple are folded"; Press 'zh'
				Observe that items containing the word are hidden/folded
				Go here and press 'z0' to remove all hide/show behaviour; Press '\f' to again uncollapse the whole HyperList
		Check "presentation mode"
			With the cursor on this item, press 'gDOWN' to go to the next item and collapse all other items
				Now again press 'gDOWN' to go to the next item in presentation mode (see this line collapsed)
			With the above line collapsed, again press 'gDOWN' to go to the next item in presentation mode

			With the cursor on this line, press '\z' and enter the required password twice to encrypt the line
			Mark the above encrypted lines visually and press '\x' to decrypt it with the password you used
			You can now create a HyperList password file and save it as ".pass.hl" (not the dot preceding the file name)
				When opening the encrypted file, VIM will automatically ask you for a password to decrypt that hyperlist
		Export to HTML
			You can convert this whole HyperList to HTML and save the output to "test.html"
			Pressing 'u' will undo the conversion, but you need to do ':set ft=hyperlist' to set the right filetype again
			Press '\H' to convert this whole HyperList to HTML format
		Export to LaTeX
			You can convert this whole HyperList to LaTeX and save the output to "test.tex"
			Pressing 'u' will undo the conversion, but you need to do ':set ft=hyperlist' to set the right filetype again
			Press '\L' to convert this whole HyperList to HTML format
		Export to TPP
			tpp: <https://github.com/cbbrowne/tpp>
			You can convert this whole HyperList to the TPP presentation format and save the output to "test.tpp"
			Pressing 'u' will undo the conversion, but you need to do ':set ft=hyperlist' to set the right filetype again
			Press '\T' to convert this whole HyperList to HTML format
		Export lines to your Google calendar
			To use this feature, you need to have the program 'gcalcli' installed and properly set up
				gcalcli: <https://github.com/insanum/gcalcli>
				Now press '\G' to see that the below item appears in your Google calendar at the correct time
				2020-01-01 08:00: Item from the HyperList Test Suite
		Show the complexity level of this HyperList
			Using ':call Complexity()' you should see the number "157" displayed
	MENU TEST
		When opening <HyperListTestSuite.hl>
				The "HyperList" menu item should appear in the menu line
			During insert operations('i,'o','O','a','A', etc)
				The menu should be greyed out
			Using 'ESC' at the end of insert operations should un-grey the menu
		Selecting the menu
			A TearOff dashed line appear at the top
				Clicking the TearOff dashed line
					The Hyperlist menu should detach and be moveable
					Menu items ending with '>>', when selected, also show a TearOff line and a submenu
					Each submenu should detach when their TearOff line is clicked
		Closing TearOff Menus
			Each Torn off menu should have an 'x' in the upper right corner
			Each Torn off menu should close when the 'x' is clicked
			All torn off menus should close when Gvim closes
		Go through all parts of the <FUNCTIONALITY TEST> using the gVIM menus to see that they work correctly
